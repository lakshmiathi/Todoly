# Todoly
**What is Todoly?**

* This project will allow the user to have a record of to-do tasks. 


* The application will allow a user to create new tasks by giving them a title, due date, and project for the task to belong to. 


* They will need to use a text based user interface via the command-line.


* It also allows the user to edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored. 



* The interface would look similar to the mock-up below:
